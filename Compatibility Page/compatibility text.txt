Compatibility

Compatibility testing is in progress for the impending release, and I will post an update once more results have been obtained

The emulator uses v1.37c of the Snes9x core, and should thus run all the games that the PC v1.37c will run ... However I am aware of a few exceptions to this ...

Several games don't like running with sound disabled so if a game crashes/locks-up it is worth trying it with sound enabled. I will try to fix this problem in a future release of the emulator.

Also a couple of C4 and SA1 based games don't behave properly. This will also be investigated for future releases.

Any other issues found may be reported on the forums which will be available shortly.
