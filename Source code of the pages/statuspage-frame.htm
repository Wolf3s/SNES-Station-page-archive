<h2>March 06, 2002</h2>
Since I restarted work on the emulator a couple of months ago I have been pretty busy ...<br>
<br>
I've been writing/porting my own libraries for the PS2, and have started using the GNU compiler.<br>By using my own libraries this has allowed me to do numerous optimisations to fairly basic functions, which otherwise do not make full use of the EE processor.<br>
I have also been working on some optimisations to the emulators graphics core, which should (when finished) give some further speed increases.<br>
<br>
I hope to have almost all games (maybe with the exception of SuperFX stuff) running at full framerate, before the first public release.<br><br>I will not promise a release date for the first public release, but I do hope this will be soon. (The first public release is likely to be lacking sound/savegame support - but these should make it into the second public release)<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>August 20, 2001</h2>
An update at last !<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Simple GUI working nicely<br>
    An INI file is used to give readable names for the GUI.<br>
    This seemed preferable to using ROM headers which are often corrupt</li>
<li>A Controller bug has been fixed, this was affecting several games<br>
    (including the Donkey Kong Country &amp; Bomberman series)</li>
<li>The core has been updated to v1.37c (the current latest core)</li>
<li>SuperFX emulation is now working<br>
    (This is currently VERY slow, since it is using the 'C' core)</li>
</ul>
There is still much to do ...
<ul>
<li>Fix DSP1 Emulation (I wanna play PilotWings and MarioKart ;)</li>
<li>Add auto frameskip (hopefully this wont be needed permanently)</li>
<li>Add sound support (shouldnt be too hard)</li>
<li>Optimise!!!<br>
    I have quite a few ideas on how to speed things up<br>
    Speed is currently 50%-100% depending on game (except superfx)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h2>July 23, 2001</h2>
Just a quick update to say that I have fixed the screen cropping bug, but haven't had much time for any further progress over the past couple of days.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>July 19, 2001</h2>
As mentioned on the news page I got the emulator running properly with a pretty decent display last night. The only graphical glitch (which isn't present in any other port of Snes9x - I'm currently using the v1.29 core) is that the right-hand 1/12th of the screen is cropped. (I should be able to get this sorted soon)<br>
<br>
The speed of the emulator is not fixed at the moment (no frame-skipping etc), and with VSync enabled the emulator is running at between 38fps and 58fps.<br>
<br>
It should be possible to increase the speed quite soon, as the code still contains a lot of debug stuff, and is not optimised at all. I think I should be able to get a steady 60fps for the final release (whenever that may be).<br>
<br>
My objectives for the next couple of weeks are ...<br>
<ul>
<li>Fix the graphics cropping bug</li>
<li>Get ROMs loading from CD (currently just loading a ROM of fixed name via firewire)</li>
<li>Move to a newer Snes9x core (currently using v1.29, probably move to v1.37c)
<li>Add sound support (Sound is currently emulated, but the PS2s sound hardware is not in use yet)
<li>Start work on a GUI for selecting ROMs from CD</li>
<li>Start work on optimisation (may offload some tasks to the PS2s IOP, or might write some of the core in EE assembler)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h2>July 05, 2001</h2>
I've re-started work on debugging the gfx display code, but time is limited, so it may be a little while before much progress is made. However I'm pretty sure that I know what the main problems are and how to fix them, so it's just a matter of time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>June 15, 2001</h2>
The emulator core is pretty much ported. And the emulator will now load a rom of a fixed name via firewire. I've been debugging the gfx display code, and work is progressing well.<br>
<br>
The emulator will be on hold for 2 weeks while I'm away, but I will continue when I return.<br>
<br>
The next few tasks are to finish debugging the display code, add a basic gui, and do the cdrom loading code. Sound support and mem-card saves will be added at a later date.<br>
