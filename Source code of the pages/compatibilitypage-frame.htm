<h1>Compatibility</h1>

<h2>June 13, 2003</h2>
Compatibility testing is in progress for the impending release, and I will post an update once more results have been obtained<br>
<br><br>

<h2>July 21, 2002</h2>
The emulator uses v1.37c of the Snes9x core, and should thus run all the games that the PC v1.37c will run ... 
However I am aware of a few exceptions to this ... <br><br>
Several games don't like running with sound disabled so if a game crashes/locks-up it is worth trying it with sound enabled. 
I will try to fix this problem in a future release of the emulator.<br>
<br>
Also a couple of C4 and SA1 based games don't behave properly. This will also be investigated for future releases.<br>
<br>
Any other issues found may be reported on the forums which will be available shortly.<br>
<br><br>
